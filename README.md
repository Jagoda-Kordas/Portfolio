# Portfolio
**My Tester's Portfolio.**

This is the place where I add information about my skills, achievements, work results. I upload here created documentations and projects in which I am participate.

I would like to keep all topic related to software testing in one place.

I hope this place will be my Tester showcase, which will develop together with me :) 
If you have any advice or observations for my work, please leave me the feedback. I will appreciate it very much.



## About me
For 3 years I've been running my own business based on Virtual Reality and I've been organizing VR zones for events. I would like to develop my company about creating VR and AR applications. I am just working on it. IT and new technologies are very close to me that's why I decided to develop in this field. 

Continuous development of my skills, broadening competences and learning new things are definitely my main goals related to developing in the IT industry. I decided to become a tester because I care about quality of products and I would like to make an contribution in developing better software. I am very meticulous person and I care about details which is helpful in testing. I am an absolvent of the course 'Tester manualny' in Coders Lab school. Despite my small experience, I can state that testing is what develops and satisfies me.

Currently I am taking part in 2 testing projects conducting by Cherry-IT. I am doing exploratory tests for below applications:
* ProteGO Safe
* WHO - MyHealth

I am looking for a place where I can develop as a tester. I am ready for new challenges.

## Bug reports

### [ProteGO Safe](https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/protego-safe--pobierz-zainstaluj-przetestuj)
[Bugs reported for mobile aplication ProteGO Safe.](https://quac.org/projects/SafeSafe/Mantis/print_all_bug_page_word.php?search=&sort=last_updated&dir=ASC&type_page=html&export=-1&show_flag=0&filter=5ead6c8fad34b)

Bugs were reported to MantisBT. All team is working together on one project in MantisBT. We add comments, informations about reproduction and other important issues.

Previously, before merge with ProteGO Safe, the testing project was based on application Safe Safe. It is the reason why the name of project in MantisBT is different.
