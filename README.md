My Tester's Portfolio

## About me
My name is Jagoda Kordas. For 3 years I've been running my own bussines based on Virual Reality and I've been orgnizing VR zones for eventes. I would like to develop my company about creating VR and AR applications. I am just working on it. IT and new technologies are very close to me that's why I decided to develop in this field. Continuous development of my skills, broadening competences and learning new things are definitely my main goals related to developing in the IT industry. I decided to become a tester because I care about quality of products and I would like to make an contribution in developing better software. I am very meticulous person and I care about details which is helpful in testing. I am an absolvent of the course 'Tester manualny' in Coders Lab school. Despite my small experience, I can state that testing is what develops and satisfies me.
I am currently looking for a place where I can develop as a tester. I am ready for new challenges.
