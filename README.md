# Portfolio
**My Tester's Portfolio.**

This is the place where I publish information about my skills, achievements and work results. Files shared in my portfolio will help illustrate my knowledge and experience.


I hope this place will be my Tester showcase, which will develop together with me :) 
If you have any advice or observations for my work, please leave me the feedback. I will appreciate it.



## About me
I’ve been developing as a Tester. Continuous development, learning new skills and gaining experience describe best my days. I have over 5 years experience in marketing and for 3 years I’ve been running my own business based on Virtual Reality. Contacting with clients, both technicals and non-technicals is my everyday work. It helps me to recognize and understand them needs. Work experience in different industries broaden my horizons and learned how to organize day in the most efficient way.  

Continuous development of my skills and broadening competences are definitely my main goals related to developing in the IT industry. I decided to become a tester because I care about quality of products and I would like to make an contribution in developing better software. I am very meticulous person and I care about details which is helpful in testing. I am an absolvent of the course 'Tester manualny' in Coders Lab School. I can state that testing is what develops and satisfies me.

Currently I am taking part in 3 testing projects conducting by [Cherry-IT](http://cherry-it.pl/). I am doing exploratory tests for below applications:
* ProteGO Safe
* WHO - MyHealth
* Naviko Crowdtesting

Moreover I am active  on the uTest platform. 

I am currently looking for job opportunities that will enable me to develop as a Tester. I am ready for new challenges.

Bugs were reported to **MantisBT**. All team is working together on the project in MantisBT. We add comments, informations about reproduction and other important issues.

Previously, before merge with ProteGO Safe, the testing project was based on application Safe Safe. It is the reason why the name of project in MantisBT is different.
